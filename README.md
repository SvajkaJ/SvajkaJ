## Dabing (Master's thesis)
- **Title:** Monitoring device of the DAB+ broadcasting
- **Abstract:** In the recent decade, substantial progress in the area of radio broadcasting has been made. Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) or newer DAB+ is already widespread in most of Europe and several other countries across the globe. Admittedly, a reasonable level of broadcast quality must be delivered. Equally important, the Software Defined Radio (SDR) receivers are more widespread, powerful and affordable than ever before. Nowadays, a low-cost RTL-SDR with a good antenna coupled with a decoding software running on a powerful microcomputer such as Raspberry Pi can be used to receive any broadcast in the supported frequency range of the tuner and decode the received signal. The aim of this thesis is to create a monitoring device of the DAB+ broadcasting on the principle of SDR, consisting of a RTL-SDR and a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. The quality indicators of the DAB+ broadcasting examined in this thesis are RF input level, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Fast Information Block Error Ratio (FIBER). The monitoring device presented in this thesis deals with Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) protocols as a means of managing, monitoring and configuring the presented device. The important parts of the software used in this thesis are also presented.

## react-spectrogram
- It is a ReactJS component that visualizes the spectrum of frequencies of a signal that varies with time - Spectrogram.
- It is written in Typescript programming language and it is publicly available at [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spectrogram) platform.
- I developed this component specifically for my Master's thesis project.

## HeizBooster
- Its purpose is to effectively dissipate heat of a typical heater by forced convection. The microcontroller manages the 12V DC fans depending on the current temperature measured by DS18B20 temperature sensor.
- Arduino Nano microcontroller
- C/C++ programming language
- PlatformIO used
- I designed custom Printed Circuit Board in EasyEDA and manufactured by JLCPCB.

## Termalizator
- Termalizator is an embedded system for the ESP8266 which enables user to switch the GPIO pin depending on the current temperature measured by DS18B20 temperature sensor.
- The device is controlled via a website.
- ESP8266 microcontroller
- C/C++ programming language
- PlatformIO used
- I made two different variants of this idea.
